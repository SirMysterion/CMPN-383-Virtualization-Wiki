# How to use DigitalOcean

Digital Ocean is designed with a number of computers that offer an outstanding feature, called a server. By meeting the requirements set by the server, we can create a Virtual Private Server (container). A VPS is a virtual machine, which uses part of the server's resources (CPU, RAM, HDD) and runs a copy of its own operating system and provides user (root) access to the clients of Digital Ocean. This means that each customer has the right to create what they want, which can have a separate container, running the chosen operating system. Customers have administrator access to the VPS, so they can change without fear of conflicts with other users who have the same containers on the same Digital Ocean server. With Digital Ocean, you will have your own server, you have full control, set parameters, select applications and most importantly, you can customize the services accordingly
