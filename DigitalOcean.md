# Brief History 

DigitalOcean is an American cloud company which provides cloud hosting server provisioning, with a focus on software developers. DigitalOcean was founded by Ben and Moisey Uretsky in June 24th, 2011. The Uretskys had already established a company back in 2003 called Server Stack, which was a managed hosting business. Most companies at the time were only targeting corporate clients who required a cloud infrastructure to manage their servers on a larger scale. They were ambitious to fulfill that gap and create a profitable future for themselves. None of the companies among the competitors were targeting individual software developers and small-scale companies as their potential customers. Due to this Ben and Moisey were ambitious and wanted to get rid of that gap, and wanted to create a new product which would combine the web hosting and virtual servers for the untapped market. After extensive research, Ben and Moisey Uretsky founded DigitalOcean; a company that provides cloud hosting services and server provisioning for individual users and small-scale start-ups making it easy for them to host their websites with one-click solutions.

In 2012 the Uretskys met co-founder Mitch Wainer, following Wainer's response to a Craigslist job listing. The company launched their beta product in January 2012 and became a part of a start-up accelerator program by none other than TechStars. By the end of this start-up accelerator program, the company was able to sign up nearly 400 customers and provided more than 10,000 instances of cloud servers. At the beginning of 2013, itâ€™s among the first few companies to offer SSD-based virtual machines for a seamless experience. On January 16th, 2018, new droplet (virtual machines) plans were introduced on their blog. In May 2018, the company announced the launch of its Kubernetes-based container service.

Right now, the company is under the leadership of the former CEO of Citrix; Mark Templeton, who took over from Ben Uretsky in April 2016.

# How to use DigitalOcean

Digital Ocean is designed with a number of computers that offer an outstanding feature, called a server. By meeting the requirements set by the server, we can create a Virtual Private Server (container). A VPS is a virtual machine, which uses part of the server's resources (CPU, RAM, HDD) and runs a copy of its own operating system and provides user (root) access to the clients of Digital Ocean. This means that each customer has the right to create what they want, which can have a separate container, running the chosen operating system. Customers have administrator access to the VPS, so they can change without fear of conflicts with other users who have the same containers on the same Digital Ocean server. With Digital Ocean, you will have your own server, you have full control, set parameters, select applications and most importantly, you can customize the services accordingly
