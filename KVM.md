### What is KVM
KVM, Kernal-based Virtual Machine, is one of the foremost open-source virtualization technologies that are utilized nowadays. IBM and Red Hat, multinational technology companies, use KVM as the premise for their Linux virtualization technologies, and it is most popularly used in the OpenStack cloud as well.

KVM, a virtualization module, found within the Linux kernel and it allows the kernel to act and function as a hypervisor. It provides hardware-assisted virtualization for a wide assortment of guest operating systems including Linux, Solaris, BSD, Windows, Haiku, macOS, and ReactOS. In addition, Android 2.2, GNU/Hurd, and many more other operating systems that are known to work, but with certain impediments. KVM furthermore provides paravirtualization support for Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Windows guests using the VirtIO API. This incorporates a paravirtual ethernet card, disk I/O controller, balloon device, and a VGA graphics interface using SPICE or VMware drivers. To utilize KVM, it requires a CPU processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intelâ€™s Virtualization Technology or AMD Virtualization. 

### History
KVM was originally written and developed by Avi Kivity, an Israeli software developer, in Mid-2006 while working at Qumranet, an enterprise software company that was acquired by Red Hat in 2008.

KVM emerged in 2006 and merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.20 on February 5, 2007.
