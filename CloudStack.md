## What is CloudStack?
CloudStack can be defined as an open-source cloud computing software for creating, managing, and deploying infastructure cloud services. It is designed to deploy and manage large networks of Virtual Machines, while also being highly available and scalable. The software uses existing popular Hypervisor platforms such as KVM, VMware Vsphere with ESXI and vCentre, and XenServer/XCP. CloudStack is Java based and provides support for it's own API, though also provides support for AWS (Amazon Web Services) and open cloud computing interface via the open grid forum.
